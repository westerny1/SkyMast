HI!

- front-end can now run locally without getting files from css online
- login is now connected with back-end (for testing)
- pero hindi pa siya nakakapost since need muna iconnect yung list of accounts sa backend bago makapost
- not yet uploaded: files ng list of accounts with settings and delete button
