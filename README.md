## Rationale
Decentralized social media offers an alternative to mainstream social media. These decentralized social media allow online interaction by distributing control and data ownership across a network of nodes rather than relying on a single corporate entity. Bluesky and Mastodon are examples of such. A user, with multiple accounts from these platforms, needs a web application that will allow them to cross-post the two platforms and manage the settings of these posts from a single screen.
