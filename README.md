## Rationale
Decentralized social media offers an alternative to mainstream social media. These decentralized social media allow online interaction by distributing control and data ownership across a network of nodes rather than relying on a single corporate entity. Bluesky and Mastodon are examples of such. A user, with multiple accounts from these platforms, needs a web application that will allow them to cross-post the two platforms and manage the settings of these posts from a single screen.

This web application aims to design and develop a software solution that enables cross-posting between the Mastodon and Bluesky social media platforms. The project involves a comprehensive set of tasks focusing on the development of a user-friendly interface and the integration of functionalities that enable efficient content management and dissemination across the two platforms. The software solution is designed to be robust and seamless, providing a valuable tool for individuals and businesses seeking to maximize their social media presence and reach a wider audience.
